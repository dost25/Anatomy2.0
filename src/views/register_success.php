        <b>Please contact</b> a 3DModels administrator of your university. The administrator will
        enable your account. Afterwards, you can login with lecturer rights.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Why is a confirmation needed?</b> <br>
        Your account enables functionality that is restricted to be used by lecturers only. The administrator therefore makes sure, that
        only lecturers have an account.

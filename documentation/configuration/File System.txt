1.2 Model Storage Format

The following directory structure must be followed when uploading models:

-> root
	-> models
		-> [MODEL UNIQUE ID]
			-> [MODEL UNIQUE ID].x3d
			-> textures
				-> texture_1.png
				...
		...

Note that [MODEL UNIQUE ID] is the ID that will be given to the model upon being entered to database.

Textures can keep their names, however they must be contained under the textures folder of the model and references of the x3dom file must be set accordingly.

Example

-> root
	-> models
		-> 1
			-> 1.x3dom
			-> textures
				-> texture_1.png
				-> texture_2.png
		-> 2
			-> 2.x3dom
			-> textures
				-> texture.pn

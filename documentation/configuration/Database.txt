DATABASE CONFIGURATION



1.0 Filling database config file

When deploying the Anatomy2.0, the database has to be configured. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the file "src/config/database_placeholder.php" and name it "src/config/database.php".
1. Provide host, database name, database user and user password in "src/config/database.php".
  The data has to be specified between the quotes 
(e.g. $host = "buche.informatik.rwth-aachen.de";)
  Test the database connection

To set up the database itself refer to the following information.



1.1 Access Anatomy 2.0 database 

The MySQL database server can be accessed via the following details:

Productive database:
	DB: 3DNRT
	User: 3duser
	Password: GHTJ5334

Test / development database:
	DB: 3dnrtdev
	User: 3ddevuser
	Password: 79PGZ834T

If you are using a database management tool, you can set your default database to this. ([1] has a tutorial on how to use phpMyAdmin from XAMPP to do database management)

1.2 Setting up your own database

The following steps have to be done for <tablename> = models and  <tablename> = users:

1. Execute “show create table <tablename>” (in phpmyadmin after selecting the DB on the server). This will return a SQL statement to create a similar table
2. Copy the SQL statement
3. Delete the old table in your database (“drop table <tablename>” or via phpMyAdmin in the toolbar under “operations”)
4. Execute the “create” SQL statement on your own database (the one you copied before). Now the table structure has been copied to your database
5. To copy the data as well, you can use the “export” function of phpMyAdmin and save the exported file somewhere on your machine.
6. On your machine, use phpMyAdmin to import the file
HINT: You also have to make sure, that the file structure for storing the models on your machine is the same as on the server. The structure is explained in FileStructure.txt



1.3 Connecting to Anatomy 2.0 database from eiche

1. Connect to eiche via: ssh 3dnrt@eiche.informatik.rwth-aachen.de
2. To connect mysql client to database: mysql --host=buche.informatik.rwth-aachen.de --user=<user> --password=<pw> <db_name>
3. You can now input SQL commands
4. Type \q to quit

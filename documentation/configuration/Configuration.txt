PURPOSE OF ADMINISTRATORS

The Anatomy 2.0 system decides between two kinds of users. Users are lecturers or students. The two roles differ only in certain rights, that are granted only to lecturers.

Lecturers can do the following things, that cannot be done by students:
1. Create courses and update / delete their own courses.
2. Upload models into the gallery
3. Enter the "lecturers mode" in course rooms. It is supposed to be used when holding lectures or presentations. It disables other users in the course room from navigating the model.

Some person has to decide, whether a user actually is a lecturer or not. When a user applies for being a lecturer, all admins will get informed via mail. They can then unlock the lecturer account with a single click. This is done by the admins.
